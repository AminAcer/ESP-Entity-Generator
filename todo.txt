GPS Sensor(s) (UART)
- Add UART interface
- Add GPS sensor 1 and 2

Ground Station Entity
- Using all sensor data, create an EntityPDU for the ground station
- Broadcast all data to a socket for a GUI service to display

All Sensors
- Add configurable hz to task that runs the process loop
	- (each sensor updates its measurements at different hz)

Add Scheduler Component
- Make a scheduler that properly creates/prioritizes RTOS tasks

Add Bitwise Component (maybe)
- Contains util functions that do bitwise ops cleanly

- Add Sensor Fusion for data that can come from multiple sensors
	- Add "DataManager" that stores latest fused values

Integrate LoRa antenna (future)
